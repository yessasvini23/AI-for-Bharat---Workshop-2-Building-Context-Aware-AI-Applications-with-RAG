    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases - Retrieve API. Here, we will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search. We will then augment the prompt with relevant documents and query which will go as input to Anthropic Claude V2 for generating response.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a knowledge base, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "We will cover 2 parts in the notebook:\n",
    "- Part 1, we will share how you can use `RetrieveAPI` with foundation models from Amazon Bedrock. We will use the `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` model. \n",
    "- Part 2, we will showcase the langchain integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on the knowledge base created using console/sdk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and stored in a knowledge base. For this notebook, we use a `synthetic dataset for 10K financial reports` to create the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload your documents (data source) to Amazon S3 bucket.\n",
    "2. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using [01_create_ingest_documents_test_kb_multi_ds.ipynb](/knowledge-bases/01-rag-concepts/01_create_ingest_documents_test_kb_multi_ds.ipynb)\n",

    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our notebook we will use the `Retreive API` provided by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases which converts user queries into\n",
    "embeddings, searches the knowledge base, and returns the relevant results, giving you more control to build custom\n",
    "workﬂows on top of the semantic search results. The output of the `Retrieve API` includes the the `retrieved text chunks`, the `location type` and `URI` of the source data, as well as the relevance `scores` of the retrievals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the text chunks being generated and augment it with the original prompt and pass it through the `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` model using prompt engineering patterns based on your use case.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### USE CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use Octank's financial 10k reports (sythetically generated dataset) as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. You will need the `knowledge base id` to run this example.\n",
    "In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠  For this lab we need to run the notebook based on a Python 3.10 runtime. ⚠\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out the workshop from your local environment outside of the Amazon SageMaker studio please make sure you are running a Python runtime > 3.10.\n",
